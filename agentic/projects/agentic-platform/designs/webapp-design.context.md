## 🎯 Purpose

Define the design philosophy for a hosted web application that wraps underlying CLI features, making them accessible, intuitive, and powerful for all users — regardless of their comfort level with the command line.

---

## ❤️ Philosophy

> *“Expose CLI power through web simplicity.”*

This application acts as a **visual front-end** to robust CLI commands. The goal is to retain the precision and speed of CLI tools while adding guidance, interactivity, and accessibility.

## 🔑 Principles

### ✅ CLI Fidelity

* Web UI should map 1:1 to CLI functionality
* Every form, toggle, or action maps directly to a CLI flag or subcommand
* Advanced users should be able to preview and export the raw CLI equivalent

### ✅ Guidance by Design

* Replace obscure flags with intuitive labels and tooltips
* Group related options visually (e.g., sections or steps)
* Provide real-time validation and pre-flight feedback

### ✅ Non-Blocking UX

* Actions are async and cancellable
* Web UI must reflect CLI progress via live logs, spinners, or step-by-step updates
* Errors must be as readable and recoverable as CLI errors

### ✅ Reversibility and Safety

* Show a summary or diff before any destructive action (e.g., delete, deploy)
* Allow dry-run mode and show exactly what will happen
* Confirmations should be thoughtful, not annoying

### ✅ Transparency

* Always expose the underlying CLI that will be run
* Let users copy, download, or trigger it from a terminal
* Help users graduate to the CLI, not hide it

### ✅ Accessibility & Reach

* Design mobile-friendly and keyboard-navigable interfaces
* Ensure all functionality works without mouse if needed
* Don’t bury power features — make them available when toggled

---

## 🧪 User Experience Goal

* CLI users should **feel at home**, not constrained
* New users should **gain confidence** by seeing what commands are being built behind the scenes
* Power should be **progressive** — start simple, reveal depth

> A CLI-backed webapp is not just a GUI. It’s a guided gateway to precision and speed — with training wheels that you can take off.
