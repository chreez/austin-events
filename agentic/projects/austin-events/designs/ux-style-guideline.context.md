## 🎨 Visual Identity

This site embodies the spirit of Austin’s East Side — eclectic, inclusive, and boldly expressive. Inspired by the neighborhood’s vibrant murals and community-first ethos, the design should feel like walking through an open-air gallery on a warm evening: full of life, grit, and local color.

## 🧭 Core Design Principles

- **Authentically Local**  
  Use visual cues that are unmistakably Austin: hand-painted signage, wheatpaste textures, backyard string lights, and vintage typography.

- **Bold Color Palette**  
  Prioritize saturated hues (sunset orange, turquoise, cactus green, hot pink) grounded by natural neutrals (earth brown, limestone white).

- **Illustration-First**  
  Favor hand-drawn elements, imperfect lines, and mural-style vector art. Avoid sterile iconography or heavy use of stock graphics.

- **Expressive Typography**  
  Use playful, bold display fonts for headlines (e.g., custom brush or slab serif styles). Pair with clean but warm body fonts that retain human feel.

- **Modular Layouts**  
  Content should feel like pieces on a street bulletin board: varied tile sizes, overlapping cards, and asymmetric grids encouraged.

## 🧠 Content Priorities

- **Events First**  
  Prioritize upcoming events, workshops, and gatherings. Use large feature areas for the next major event.

- **Faces of the Community**  
  Include profile sketches, contributor quotes, and community-made art. The site should feel lived-in and built by its people.

- **Real-Time Vibe**  
  Allow dynamic updates like live countdowns, weather-based styling changes, or featured Spotify playlists from local artists.
