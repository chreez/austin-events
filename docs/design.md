# Austin Events Design

## Event API Sources
- Primary: [Ticketmaster Discovery API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/)
  - Provides events with categories such as Music, Sports, and Arts.
- Backup: [Eventbrite Public Events](https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api#/)
  - Useful fallback when Ticketmaster data is insufficient.

## User Role Taxonomy
- **Guest**: Can browse and filter events.
- **User**: Can save favorites once accounts are introduced.
- **Admin**: Can create, edit, and remove events.
